- This book is amazing in explaining and applying SOLID principles and many common design patterns.
- The main benifit of the book is it give a quick theoritical introduction then start applying in a really advanced way the clean (onion) architecture.
- Some parts was very brief, So I got help from other resources.
- Other benifit of the book is applying the principles in a small project that getting bigger throughout the book, and it also apply how to trabsfer the project from a framework to another to expose the concepts of decoupling. So, you will find it go from Zend, Laravel to Symfony.
- It's a short review as it's more like my impression for a good journey :)
